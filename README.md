### Flagger - a ReactJS flag identification project

This is the typescript version of the project.

#### Project Overview

The aim of this project is to allow the user to identify a flag by ticking boxes about its characteristics.
The React programme then immediately displays the results that correspond to the user's input.
The user can also click on a flag to be redirected to Wikipedia's page about that country.
Flagger has over three hundred flags.
The project uses the flags of all independent states, including unrecognised states, official alternative flags for a number of countries, and nearly all civil and naval ensigns currently in use. 
Some other flags of the British Isles are included.
Historic flags are not included.

#### Before using the application

Before first use:
1. Install NodeJS, if it is not already installed on your system.
2. Install Typescript, using `npm install --global typescript`.
3. Use the command `npm install` on the root directory.

#### Using the application

Go to the root directory and type `npm start` into the terminal. The programme should then open automatically in a new window.
